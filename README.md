In this repository, we'll show you how to get started with your
first bot on Regression Games! By the end of the tutorial, you will
have a bot that can:

* Heal using potions
* Equip armor
* Attack the flag carrier and other nearby enemies
* Capture the flag and bring it back to base
* Collect items such as potions, weapons, and blocks
* Place blocks on chokepoints to slow the enemy

There are a few ways to get started.

   feature to follow along.
2. Complete the tutorial on your own (we have copied all Replit tutorial
   materials into this Readme)
3. Simply clone this repository and start from the completed code.
